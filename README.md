## Simple Calculator Project

This repository contains a basic JavaScript calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:
Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Includes clear (AC) and delete (DEL) buttons for user convenience
Displays calculations and results in a user-friendly interface

Requirements:
A web browser compatible with modern web standards (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)
Getting Started:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-project.git

Use code with caution.

Open the index.html file:
You can open the file directly in your web browser or use a local server environment.


How it Works:
The HTML code structures the calculator's visual layout, including the input field, buttons, and overall layout.
The CSS code styles the calculator's visual elements, defining colors, fonts, spacing, and overall aesthetics.
The JavaScript code handles user interactions and calculations:
It retrieves references to the input field and all buttons.
It initializes an empty string to store user input.
It loops through all buttons and attaches event listeners to handle clicks.
When a button is clicked:
If it's the equal sign (=), it evaluates the expression using eval() and displays the result in the input field.
If it's clear (AC), it clears the input field and the stored string.
If it's delete (DEL), it removes the last character from the input field and the stored string.
Otherwise, it appends the button's value to the input field and the stored string.


Additional Notes:
The eval() function can be a security risk in certain contexts. Consider alternative approaches for evaluating expressions if security is a concern.
This is a basic calculator implementation. You can extend its functionality to include more complex operations, error handling, and advanced features as needed.
